# Laptop-Reviews-Analysis-using-SQL
SQL project to gain business insights by examining product ratings, review trends, and customer sentiments.

This project analyzes 24,000 laptop product reviews scraped from Flipkart, covering around 600 different laptop models. The goal is to gain business insights by examining product ratings, review trends, and customer sentiments.

By leveraging SQL queries, I aim to answer key business questions such as:
--Which laptop brands are the most trusted?
--What factors impact customer ratings?
--Are highly reviewed laptops always highly rated?
--What are common issues in negative reviews?
--How do premium and budget laptops compare?

The insights generated from this project can help businesses, retailers, and manufacturers improve their products and customer satisfaction.
